# Guessing Game
This guessing game is my go-to project for learning new programming languages.
It is intended to be completed in an active-learning style with the
aid of the official docs for the language and [LearnXInYMinutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/).
It is shamelessly stolen (with gratitude :heart:) from the
[official rust programming language
guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/2018-edition/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html).
I have added additional requirements meant to give the programmer the
opportunity to expose themselves to several important aspects of any programming
language. These include:
- Basic data-types (bool, int, float, string, etc.)
- I/O and string formatting
- error handling (exceptions, result types, or whatever the de facto best
  pratices are)
- random numbers / random data generation
- imports and packages
- abstact data types (lists, hash tables, BSTs, etc.)
- classes/modules/etc.
- algebraic data-types (records/variants), if supported
- threading / async programming

The specification for the guessing game can be found in SPECIFICATION.
